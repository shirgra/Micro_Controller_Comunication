# Micro Controller Comunication
###### Implementation of the Physical layer and  Data link layer with protocols.

## About the project:
- The project was built in spring of 2020, during my fourth semester, in "Computer Communication Networks". 
- The project was done in pairs. I worked with Aseel Asly.
- In the **Physical layer** AKA "Phy", we implemented with Asynchronous Communication with a structure of data frames.
- In the **Data link layer** AKA "DLL", we implemented with 'Stop & Wait' protocol.
- All the code is written in C language.

## Compilation and running instructions:
- The project is ment for **STM32F303 and STM32F308** microcontrollers, pruducts of "ST" company (Link attached [here](https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors.html))
- To run the project, the operating system should have the following programs:
  1. [Keil µVision® IDE](http://www2.keil.com/mdk5/uvision/) - Compilations and loading to the microcontrollers.
  2. [Tera-Term (open source proj.)](https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en) - Input-Output port for the DLL micro-controller.
  3. [STM-Studio](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm-studio-stm32.html) - STM Studio run-time variables monitoring and visualization tool for STM32 microcontrollers.
- After creating the correct work envirunment, connect the controllers to the computer.
- Run and compile the code with 'Keil'.

## Additional attachments to the code:
- The given task and instuctions.
- Design plans for writing the code.
- The complete compiled package for running the code in 'Keil'.
